 *Class Overview: The purpose of this class is to function like an arithmetic sequence
 *Class Invariant:  Constuctor 1st argument can take only positive numbers
 *                  forbidden list can be any number that doesn't overflow an int
 *                  yield() behaves differently depending on what state the obj is in
 *                  numGen() returns depending on how many times yield is called
 *                  getmodechangeCount() returns depending on how many times you state switched
 *                  if yield's return is in the forbidden set then yield's return will be the last number that wasn't in the forbidden set and before threshold
 *                  There are accessors to get information about arithS
 *                  Obj is defaulted to stuck mode
 *                  
 *Interface Invariant:  current always starts out at 0
     *                  threshold is at 5. so forbidden will happen after 5 numbers have been generated.
     *                  Constructor takes in a 2 arg in param. 1st arg = sequence number which increments your return value for yield.
     *                                                         2nd arg = a int array you pass in and when the amount of calls you made exceeds the threshold(5) then you cannot return numbers in the forbidden set
     *                  arithS has three states. Stuck,Advance,Retreat
     *                  Stuck - when yield() is called return will never increment.
     *                  Advance - when yield() is called return will increment by sequence int
     *                  You can switch to these three states by using switchAdvance(),switchStuck(),switchRetreat()
     *                  reset() - resets this obj to its intial state with the same sequence and forbidden
     *                  numGen() - returns the number of generated numbers called from yield()

 * Implementation invariant: current is intialized at 0

 *                           lastnum is the last number before yield is in forbidden set
 *                           tresholdCheck(int) checks if the amount of yield calls exceed threshold
 *                           inForbidden(int) checks if yield's return is in the forbidden set
 *                           forbiddenCheck(int) decides what to do with the number if its in forbiddenset
 *                           obj's state is intialized to stuck by default
 *                           if obj is in neither of the 3 states yield will return -1
 *                           I set the starting value to 0 since 0 isn't a error code
 *                          made numgen a virtual function because its different for skipA
