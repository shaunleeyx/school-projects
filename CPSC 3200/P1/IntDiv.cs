/**
 *Class Overview: This class gets the remainder of two numbers with some rules explained in the invariances
 *Class Invariant:active is true and perm is false when intialized by constructor.active changes when test returns the same number twice. perm changes to false when reset() is invoked when active is true
 *Interface Invariant:div number is positive. negative div and 0 numbers default to 1 so no divide by 0. When active is false it disables the functionality of test(). This can be fixed by reset(). However if perm is active it is permanently disabled

//Implementation invariant:test() returns -1 when active is false and -2 when perm inactive is true. negative div and 0 numbers default to 1. i set lastnum to -1 because lastnum can only be positive it doesn't overlap incase the first number the client test() is the lastnum
