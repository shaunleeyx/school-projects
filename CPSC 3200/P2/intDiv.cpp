 *Version 1.2
 *Platform:VSCode
 *Class Overview: This class gets the remainder of two numbers with some rules explained in the invariances
 *
 *Class Invariant:active is true and perm is false when intialized by constructor.
 *                active changes when test returns the same number twice.
 *                perm changes to false when reset() is invoked when active is true
 *                reset() resets the program to its default state even if its permanently deactivated
 *                revive() resets the program to its default state if its inactive and is permanently deactivated when used while its active
 *                num in constructor has to be from 0 to 2147483648 
 *                num passed in test has to be from -2147483648 to 2147483648
 *                num in test is unsigned
 *                if inactive then test() will return -1
 *                if perminactive then test() will return -2 
 * 
 * Implementation invariant: renamed reset() to revive()
 * (with assumptions)        removed getPerm()
 *                           change the argument of the constructor to a uint
 *                           renamed field perm to perminactive
 *                           made a if statement in the revive function that if perminactive is active then it just returns
 *                           reset() resets the program to its default state even if its permanently deactivated
 *                           revive() resets the program to its default state if its inactive and is permanently deactivated when used while its active
 *                           changed line 66 from active = true to active = !active;
 *                           if inactive then test() will return -1
 *                           if perminactive then test() will return -2
