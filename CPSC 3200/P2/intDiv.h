 *Platform:VSCode
 *Interface Invariant:div number is positive.
 *                             negative div and 0 numbers default to 1 so no divide by 0.
 *                             When active is false it disables the functionality of test().
 *                             This can be fixed by reset(). However if perm is active it is permanently disabled
